/**
 * Returns a named_ptr where the content of the pointer has been allocated.
 * Calling function needs to verify that the allocated pointer
 * is not NULL.
 * It's common that the .ptr field holds a struct that ends with a 'char name[1]'
 * field. That way, by setting 'nameoffset' correctly, the name field in the struct
 * can share memory with the .name allocated by this function, by allowing the
 * struct name to "overflow" the struct boundaries into the <named_ptr>.name memory.
 * 
 * size: size of memory for the .ptr (just like for malloc). Do NOT take into account size
 *     for the name since this function handles that.
 * nameoffset: write the name at offset from the start of the requested 'size'
 *     Impl. note: this needs to be calculated by caller, because it's possible
 *     to get different byte padding of the struct, and it allows the function
 *     to be used without structs that end with a name field.
